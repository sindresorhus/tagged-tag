# tagged-tag

> Unique tag used in the [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest) [`Tagged`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/a6612048e1bf4c6e787b1a10007dd90c5c9f34e7/source/opaque.d.ts#L122-L184) type

This package provides a singular, unified tag to prevent the duplication of tag symbols when multiple versions of type-fest coexist in a project's dependency tree. Such duplication could lead to ambiguity when using the `Tagged` type. Because of this, this package will never have another major version.
